BONUS CHALLENGE FORM
--------------------

For each bonus challenge you have implemented, please replace the sentence "We are not entitled to this bonus."
with a short description of:

1. How it was implemented in your code
2. Where it was used (in which class methods).
3. How you tested that it is working correctly.

--------------------

1. Fully supporting all configuration fields and avoiding the use of magic numbers

1. We used only the config final fields given by the config file.
2. Across all of the project, specifically in Table and Dealer classes
3. We Used unit tests AND Manual tests(we chagne the configuration file values and saw how the game changed accordingly).

--------------------

2. Terminating all threads (that you created) gracefully and in reverse order to the order they were created in.

1. The terminate function of the Dealer firstly calls the terminate function of the players, the players timer threads and main timer run functions stops (while condition(time > 0) is false and then the thread stop and termintae automaticaly). 
2. Dealer class(terminate),player class(terminate).
3.We printed every time a thread is terminated an saw the order and checked the logger .

--------------------

3. Handling the config.turnTimeoutMillis value as follows:
config.turnTimeoutMillis < 0: display nothing.
config.turnTimeoutMillis = 0: display a timer since the last action (reshuffle or set collected).
Note: in modes without a countdown timer the dealer must ensure there is always at least one legal set on the table.

1.We created a class TIMER, that implements runnable. The run method while condition is time > 0. when time reaches zero, notifys the dealer. the reset time function reset the time value to config.turnTimeoutMillis.
2. The main timer was used in the Dealer class
3. We manauly set config.turnTimeoutMillis value and saw the Thread display accordingly.

--------------------

4. Making sure that the threads do not wake up unless some actual job needs to be done (e.g., a value needs to be
changed on the display, key input needs to be handled, etc.) and the only threads created by you are:
1 thread per player + 1 additional thread for non-human players.

We are not entitled to this bonus.
